This repository includes the source code and prepared dataset for the proposed topic "A DEEP CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK-BASED APPROACH FOR VISUAL SEARCH & RECOMMENDATION OF GROCERY PRODUCTS". The dataset folder contains our prepared dataset and the source code folder contains four ipynb files.

I am attaching the google drive link containing the models produced along with the source code and the prepared dataset for further convenience.
